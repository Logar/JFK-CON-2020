He and Pease also edited the journal \"Probe\" (1993-2000) which focused on the releases of the ARRB and developments in the MLK and RFK cases.</p><p> DiEugenio has an MA in Contemporary American History from California State University Northridge.

When the famed journalist, called by the New York Post, \"the most powerful voice in America,\" was found dead in her Manhattan apartment in November 1965 of an alleged drug overdose, no investigation occurred despite a staged death scene and suspicions by those closest to her that she had been murdered.</p><p>Now the full thrust of Kilgallen's search for the truth is exposed for the first time in former USA Today and CNN legal analyst Mark Shaw's 25th book, \"The Reporter Who Knew Too Much\" (Post Hill Press/Simon and Schuster). Relying on Kilgallen's toxic columns blasting the \"Oswald Alone\" theory, her flawed autopsy report and never-before-seen videotaped interviews with Kilgallen's two hairdressers, one who found her body, and Jack Ruby co-counsel Joe Tonahill, who befriended Kilgallen when she covered the Ruby trial while permitting her the only interviews Ruby gave to a reporter, Shaw solves the mystery of Kilgallen's shocking death by presenting the most compelling evidence about the JFK assassinations since the HSCA investigation in the 1970s.
